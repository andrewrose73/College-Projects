# College Projects in Business Analytics
These are two of my final projects that I have worked on in my progress in college while studying Business Analytics. "FinalReport-2-23-2024" is a project in my Data Mining class that involved a dive into Explatory Data Analysis (EDA) using R. As well as visualizations and Machine Learning. The Forecast and Risk file is another final project created in my Forecasting and Risk Analysis class. This projects also does an EDA using python and goes through time series forecasting. Trough this data I was able to find outliers and used plots to verify those outliers.
